# GPT-2 Reimplementation for Safety Testing

This repository contains a reimplementation of OpenAI's GPT-2 model specifically designed for safety testing and research purposes.

## Overview

This project aims to recreate GPT-2 from scratch to:
- Understand the model's internal mechanisms
- Conduct safety evaluations and testing
- Experiment with interpretability techniques
- Develop and test safety interventions

## Features

- Full GPT-2 architecture implementation
- Support for multiple model sizes (124M, 355M, 774M, 1.5B parameters)
- Training from scratch or fine-tuning capabilities
- Comprehensive safety testing framework
- Interpretability tools and visualizations

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd gpt2

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

### Training a Model

```python
python run.py --model_size 124M --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 3e-4
```

### Generating Text

```python
python sample.py --model_path ckpt/model.pt --prompt "Once upon a time"
```

### Running Safety Tests

```python
python safety_test.py --model_path ckpt/model.pt --test_suite comprehensive
```

## Safety Testing Framework

Our safety testing framework includes:

1. **Harmful Content Detection**: Tests for generation of harmful, toxic, or inappropriate content
2. **Bias Evaluation**: Analyzes model outputs for various forms of bias
3. **Robustness Testing**: Evaluates model behavior under adversarial inputs
4. **Alignment Verification**: Checks if model outputs align with intended values

## Model Architecture

The implementation follows the original GPT-2 architecture:
- Transformer decoder with self-attention
- Layer normalization
- Position embeddings
- Byte-level BPE tokenization

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve safety testing methodologies. Please ensure all contributions:
- Include comprehensive tests
- Document safety implications
- Follow our code style guidelines

## Safety Considerations

This implementation is intended for research purposes only. When using this code:
- Always monitor generated outputs
- Implement appropriate content filtering
- Consider potential misuse scenarios
- Follow responsible AI practices
